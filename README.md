# TopDownDesign
Provide a complete top down design with testing design and results as we have discussed in class for one of the following:  The iterative merge sort

<p>
  As mentioned in the first project, I went through iterative merge sort extensively by taking out pieces of the code and putting it in a separate file. I would then run the code with the piece taken out to find out what that certain chunk did. It could've ended the loop, could've intialized the variables, it could've send the loop back to the beginning, or printed out the array. There were many portions I had taken to find out how it worked and why it worked best there because I would also rearrange the code's format, just to make sure it was in the right location. This way also found what pieces of the code were important to make the rest work and if there were any unnecessary pieces that could do well with being taken out. 
 <p>
   My most important file is array.s where it has been updated from the previous one in project 1. I go through parts of the code and explain what happens when removed. This was the best method I used to really see how the project works and not just read about it. I work best through seeing how to make or break the code.
